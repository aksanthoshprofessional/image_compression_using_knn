# Image Compression using KNN

This notebook demonstrates image compression using K-Means clustering. It reduces the number of colors in an image by clustering similar colors and replacing them with cluster centroids, resulting in smaller file sizes. The notebook also calculates PSNR and visualizes compressed images for different numbers of clusters.
